## NextJS boilerplate

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) boilerplate used for my personal projects, it was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Currently it has

- [x] Typescript
- [x] Eslint + Prettier
- [x] Styled Components

### Start the development server
After installing the dependecies, you can run

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
